This is a simple fork of Zimodem for the ESP8266 to enable LED support.
Current version is 3.5.6

I started this project as a way to convert a old external modem into a wifi modem using zimodem, but I also wanted the leds on the modem to work.

This is using a small pcb with a wemos d1 mini esp8266 module, a 74244 (ls, hct, etc, shouldn't matter),along with a full rs232 to ttl adapter.
I'm using a MDFLY MOL-CV0025 from amazon.

Also needed are one .1uf cap, and eight resistors.

Resistors you should select according to your leds. Also I've found using lower resistors on the tx/rx lines can get them to about the same level as the always on leds.

This is currently a place holder as I await my boards for final testing, then I'll put them on github.
